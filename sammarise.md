# MarkDown Language 
## Why To Learn 
### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Gists 
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help.

### -Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

"> Coffee."  The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
