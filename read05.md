 # Loop 
# What is LOOP
## Loop is iterating excuting of a proccess many times untill condition valid to true .
<br>
<br>

## Operators 
- AND operator is typed ( & )
the result depend on values the must be both are true to get true result or else result must be false .
<br> 

0 & 1 = 0
<br>
0 & 0 = 0 
<br>
1 & 1 = 0
<br>
1&0 = 0
<br>

- OR  operator which typed ( || ) give result true if any value is true , but if both are false , result will be false .
<br>

0 || 0 = 0
<br>
1|| 1 = 1
<br>
0 || 1 = 1
<br>
1 || 0 = 1

- Not Operator which typed (  != )  is give the result wich oppisite of the given value .
<br>

>var a = 1;

>if (a != 0)

>alert "A";

<br>
the result will be A
because a is not equal 0 .

# Types Of Loop Sentenses
<br>

## For 
### Syntax 
for(inital value ; operator ; update)
<br>


the iteration of proccess continue excuting to have the condition applied .


<br>
<br>
<br>

## While 
### syntax 
inital value 
while(condition)
{
    statements 
    update
}

this statement check in evry iteration that the condition st applied or not , if it not applied then excuting proccess or statements until the condition applied .
